The Display App runs on a monitor above the coffee bar. It provides a list of upcoming and completed drinks. It also shows the QR code that customers scan to start their orders. This is the first of three frontends you will set up.

## Inside this section

This frontend has already been deployed and is presented as a hosted UI at https://workshop-display.serverlesscoffee.com/.

- The hosted UI presents a configuration page when you first visit this URL.
- After entering the configuration settings, it stores these in the browser's local cache.
- The settings you use are not visible to anyone else visiting the same URL.

Note the 4 admin buttons provided in the top right-hand corner:

* **Configure barista app**: Use this for transferring settings to the Barista App later in this section.
* **Configure order app**: Use this for transferring settings to the Order App later in this section.
* **Clear settings**: Empties the local settings cache and clears the backend settings. This causes the *Settings* page to be displayed the next time the page reloads. Use this if you want to change your backend settings.
* **Sign out**: Signs out the Cognito user from the frontend and returns you to the sign-in page.

The QR code shown will change every five minutes and limit the total number of orders to the value shown on the screen (10 by default). Later, in the end-to-end test, you will scan this QR code to start the ordering process.

Keep the Display App open in a browser tab.
